Notes on Running ij or h2 console for debugging:
Using h2 console
run h2.sh in h2/bin
and open localhost:8082
if you are sshed in, run ssh -L 8082:localhost:8082 <host-with-h2-db> and use the browser.

Using ij:
java -cp ../lab/derby/lib/derby.jar:../lab/derby/lib/derbytools.jar:../h2/bin/h2-1.2.133.jar org.apache.derby/tools.ij
Run 
connect 'jdbc:h2:lift_proto.db'

After that, it's usual stuff


# thing to note: h2 adds .h2.db to the end of the file anyways. So, you might end up with a bunch of these files
